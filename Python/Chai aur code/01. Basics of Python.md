### Hello world code

```py
print("Hello world")
```

#### Declaring a function

```py
def print_function(n):
    print(n)

print_function(5)
print_function("this is a function printing")
```

#### Printing a function by importing it from another file

- Keep both the files i the same folder, then create the function in first file
- Import the function in second file using this line:
  ```from file_name import function_name```

**Filename:** `module.py`
```py
def greet():
    print("Hello from another file!")
```

**Filename:** `main.py`
```py
from module import greet

greet()
```

- Now, in the same folder, a new folder will be created, named as ```__pycache__```
- The __pycache__ folder is automatically created by Python to store compiled bytecode files (.pyc) of your modules.
- When you import a module (like module.py), Python compiles it into bytecode for faster execution.
- This compiled file is saved in the __pycache__ folder (e.g., module.cpython-311.pyc).
- On future runs, Python loads the compiled version instead of re-parsing the source file, improving performance.
