## Python in shell

- There are two ways to use python in shell

  1. Using command prompt
     - type in `python` in the command prompt.
     - Python shell will open for writing python code
     - Use `ctrl+ d` or `ctrl+ z`, `enter` for exit.

  2. Using IDLE
     - Search for idle in the windows menu
     - Python shell will open directly for writing python code
     - Use `ctrl+ d` to terminate.

 - Python code written in shell is executed as soon as we type in the line of code and press enter.

#### Indentation in Python

- Used to define blocks (functions, loops, if-else, classes, etc.)
- No {} or begin-end keywords like other languages
- Mandatory â€” incorrect indentation causes IndentationError

##### Rules for Indentation
- Consistent spacing (use 4 spaces per level)
- No mixing of tabs and spaces
- Block starts after colon (`:`) and must be indented
  
 
### Using functions/variables from another module

```py
import module_name

# Using moethods from the mported module
module_name.method()

# Using variables from the imported module
module_name.variable
```

## Updating the Binaries (Bytecode Files)

Sometimes when we import a module from another file and then make changes to that module,
those changes don't show up immediately when we run the main file. <br/>
This happens because Python has already compiled the module into bytecode (in the ```__pycache__``` folder),
and it keeps using that cached version instead of the updated one.

- Solution: Use importlib.reload():
```py
from importlib import reload
reload(module_name)
```

This is especially useful during development or when testing modules without restarting the whole project.
