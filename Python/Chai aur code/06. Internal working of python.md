# Python memory management and reference counting

1. Object creation in memory
   - In Python, everything is an object (integers, lists, functions, classes, etc)
   - When we create a value,
     ```py
     a = [1,2,3]
     ```
   - A list object is created in heap memory.
   - `a` is just a reference to that object.
  
2. Reference count
   - Every object keeps track of how many references (names/pointers) point to it.
   - This count is known as `ref_count`.
   - We can check it using:
     ```py
     import sys
     x= [1,2,3]
     print(sys.getrefcount(x)) # Usually returns 2 due to temp ref in getrefcount
     ```
   - getrefcount() shows +1 because the function call itself adds a temporary reference when passing x.
  
3. Behind the scenes
   - Example:
     ```py
     a = [1, 2]
     b = a        # ref_count = 2 (both a and b point to same list)
     del a        # ref_count = 1
     del b        # ref_count = 0 → object eligible for garbage collection
     ```
  
4. Why high ref count for strings?
   - Python interns some strings for efficiency.
   - A literal like any string might be
     - Reused across the interpreter
     - Stored in symbol tables, debug info, docstrings, etc
    
   - So,
     ```py
     print(sys.getrefcount("Saakshi"))  # Can be very high like 10000+
     ```
     Even though you didn't explicitly use it that many times.
  
5. Garbage collection
   - Python uses reference counting as the primary way to manage memory.
   - When `ref_count == 0`, the object becomes eligible for garbage collection.
   - Python also has a **cyclic garbage collector** to clean up reference cycles.


## Python garbage collector (GC)

1. Reference counting (Primary mechanism)
- Python primarily uses **reference counting**.
- Every object in Python has an internal counter: `ref_count`.
- When a new reference is made (eg. Assigning to a new variable), the count increases.
- When a reference is deleted, the count decreases.
- When an object's `ref_count == 0` the object is immediately destroyed and memory is freed.
- Example,
  ```py
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a  # ref_count = 2
  del a
  del b  # ref_count = 0 → object is destroyed
  ```

2. Problem: Reference cycles
- Reference counting alone fails when objects reference each other in a cycle:
  ```py
  a = []
  b = [a]
  a.append(b)
  ```
- Here, `a -> b -> a` creates a cycle.
- Even if `del a` and `del b` are called, the cycle keeps both alive (ref_count > 0).

3. Cyclic garbage collector (Secondary mechanism)
- To solve this, Python includes a cyclic GC via the `gc` module:
- Detects reference cycles in container types (list, dict, set, custom objects)
- Periodically scans object generations to look for unreachable cycles.
- If no external references exist, even if they refer to each other, the cycle is broken and memory is freed.
  ```py
  import gc
  gc.collect()  # Manually trigger cycle detection and collection
  ```

  > Generational GC
  - Python uses three-generational model
    - Gen 0: Newest objects (Frequent checks)
    - Gen 1: Objects that survived 1 collection
    - Gen 2: Long lived objects (rarely checked)
   
4. Interning and caching (small objects)
- Small integers (-5 to 256) and many short strings are interned:
  - Stored once in memory and reused to save space and boost performance.
  - Python doesn’t delete them until the interpreter exits — or sometimes never.
    ```py
    a = 100
    b = 100
    id(a) == id(b)  # True — both point to same object
    ```

5. Delayed or skipped GC
- Python's GC ignores immutable types like:
  - `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`
- These don’t form reference cycles (immutable can't contain references), so they are managed only by reference counting, not by cyclic GC.
