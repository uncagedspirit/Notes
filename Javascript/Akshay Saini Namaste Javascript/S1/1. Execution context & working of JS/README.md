### Everything in JavaScript happens inside the execution context.

#### Execution context has two component in it:

1. Variable environment (Memory component):
	this is the component where the variables and functions in the code are stored in the form of key-value pairs.

2. Thread of execution (code component): this is the component where the code is executed one line at a time.

- JavaScript is a synchronous single threaded language.
That means, JavaScript can only execute one line at a time, that too in the order the lines are written.
