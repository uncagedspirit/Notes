## Arrays in JS

- Arrays in JavaScript are ordered collections of elements, such as numbers, strings, or objects. 
- They are zero-indexed and can store multiple values in a single variable.

### forEach()

The forEach() method in JavaScript is used to iterate over an array and execute a provided function once for each element.
It does not return a new array.

syntax:
```
array.forEach((element, index, array) => {
  // Code to execute
});
```

Example:
```
arr.forEach(function(val){
  //do the task for each value, e.g.
  console.log(val + " hello");
})
```

### map()

The map() method in JavaScript creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array without modifying the original array.
